/**
 * Cypher query to retrieve recent soil readings and plant scans for a specific farm owned by a user.
 *
 * @remarks
 * - Matches a user by `username` and their owned farm by `farmName`.
 * - Optionally matches soil readings (`Reading`) and plant scans (`PlantScan`) associated with the farm,
 *   filtering both by a cutoff datetime.
 * - Returns collections of soil readings and plant scans that are newer than the specified cutoff.
 *
 * @param {string} $username - The username of the user.
 * @param {string} $farmName - The name of the farm.
 * @param {string} $cutoff - The cutoff datetime (ISO 8601 string) to filter recent readings and scans.
 *
 * @returns {Object} An object containing:
 *   - `soilReadings`: Array of recent soil reading nodes.
 *   - `plantScans`: Array of recent plant scan nodes.
